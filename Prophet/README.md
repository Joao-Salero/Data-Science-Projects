# Real-time Interactive Dashboard for [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) Prediction with [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)


## Proposal

Dashboard to predict the value of the Ethereum cryptocurrency over time using [fbProphet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) for time series analysis.   

### Guideline 
 1. Create a new folder;
 2. Paste the **requirements** file + ether_pred.py;
 3. Open the CMD;
 4. Search the created folder;
 5. Copy this line **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**, past and execute it on the CMD;
 6. Copy this line **`streamlit run EtherPred_Prophet.py`**, past and execute it on the CMD

A new tab will open on your browser and enjoy it!

### Note:
 - I will creat more periods (minutes, hours, days...) options as soon as possible;
 - I will rearrange the script.
