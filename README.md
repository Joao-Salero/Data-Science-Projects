# Data Science Projects
 My Study Projects in Data Science

## Hi! Welcome to my repository!
 
 My name is João, Brazilian (living in Dublin/Ireland), 33-years-old. [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo%C3%A3o-s-37aa011a8/)

 My idea my idea when creating this repository is collaborating with the Machine Learning community. In addition to demonstrating my level of knowledge and my evolution in Machine Learning. 

 Some of projects are focused on Data Science and others are focused on Deep Learning. All exercises are below, divided by theme and language ([R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)).

 So, all the “mini-projects” I will review over time, updating them as I learn more techniques.

 Please, feel free to consult all the material. ###I hope I can help the community in some way###.
