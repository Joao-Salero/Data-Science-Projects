# Data Science Projects 
 
 Hi! Welcome to my repository!
 
 I'm João Salero, Brazilian (living in Dublin/Ireland), 33-years-old. [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo%C3%A3o-s-37aa011a8/)

 My idea when creating this repository is collaborating with the Machine Learning community and, in addition, to demonstrating my level of knowledge and my evolution in Machine Learning. 

 Some of projects are focused on Data Science and others are focused on Deep Learning. All exercises are below, divided by theme and language ([R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)).

 So, all the “mini-projects” I will review over time, updating them as I learn more techniques.

 Please, feel free to consult all the material. I hope I can help the community in some way!
